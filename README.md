# Fuel Consumption Calculator

## Introduction
This is a simple fuel consumption calculator application built with JavaScript. It allows users to input data such as the year, month, vacation dates, refueling dates, refueling amounts, and fuel consumption per kilometer. Based on this data, the application generates a table with calculated values including the remaining fuel in the tank, distance traveled, and refueling information.

## Usage
1. Enter the year and month for which you want to calculate fuel consumption.
2. Optionally, specify the start and end dates of your vacation.
3. Click the "Create Table" button to generate the table.
4. Input the refueling dates and amounts.
5. Click the "Add to Table" button to add refueling data to the table.
6. Enter the fuel consumption per kilometer.
7. Click the "Calculate" button to generate results.
